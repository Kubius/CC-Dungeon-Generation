# CC-Dungeon-Generation
Folder for THOLUS dungeon generator/builder and CUPOLA binary matrix interpreter

tholusMXB1: The latest version of the THOLUS dungeon generator.
Updated to work with Command Blocks and adds loot chest generation.

tholusM4B3: The last stable version prior to MX - most functionality is present.

cupola: Prints out the output from THOLUS' "burntodisk" functionality.

If you use this in any part, please credit me.
